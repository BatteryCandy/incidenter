        FINANCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS:

        Daily Revenue Loss: $12.5 million
        Daily Operating Cost Savings: $3.2 million
        Net Daily Loss: $9.3 million

        Projected Downtime Scenarios:
        • Pay Ransom (3-5 days): $28-46 million loss
        • Rebuild Systems (2-4 weeks): $130-260 million loss
        • Hybrid Approach (1-2 weeks): $65-130 million loss

        BOARD RECOMMENDATION:
        The executive team recommends PAYING THE RANSOM due to:
        1. Significant ongoing financial losses
        2. Critical national infrastructure impact
        3. Insurance coverage availability
        4. Fastest path to operational restoration
        5. Stakeholder pressure for rapid resolution

  timeline_summary: |
    4-day attack from VPN compromise (June 1) through credential stuffing,
    network lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment
    causing pipeline shutdown (June 4). Attack demonstrates how IT compromise
    can impact critical infrastructure operations even when OT systems remain secure.

    - Estimated $130-260M+ in lost revenue and incident response costs
    - Complete pipeline shutdown affecting 17 states
